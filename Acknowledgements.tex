\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
In this line of work, no man is an island, and this thesis is no exception.
I am greatly indebted to many others who have contributed in no small part to my development as both a person and a scientist throughout my tenure in graduate school.

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor, Reina Maruyama at Yale University. \color{red}add more here \color{black}

I would also like to thank Drs. Karsten Heeger and Tom Wise for their advice and support, particularly after countless meetings and nights working on the calibration system for CUORE.
Observing their problem-solving and management skills certainly taught me a lot about what it means to be a scientist.

I must also thank my fellows with whom I've spent many hours deep in the foxhole of research, particularly Jeremy Cushman, Danielle Speller, Kyungeun Lim, Ke Han, and Nic Chott. It has been a real blessing to have had such fun, hardworking, and sociable coworkers.
I have also been fortunate enough to supervise many enthusiastic undergrads, including Byron Daniel, Surya Dutta, Katie Melbourne, Ivy Wanta, and Nikita Dutta.

Outside of research, I would never had been able to keep my sanity nor have such a fantastic experience in grad school except for the sustained efforts and friendship of Stefan Krastanov, Meredith Powell, Sean Raley, Peter Williams, James Ingolby, Tonima Ananna, and many others not listed here.
I also would like to express gratitude to the hundreds of students I've had the fortune to teach at Yale.
The many late nights and weekends I spent working with you hardly felt like work at all.

My profound gratitude goes out to my parents for providing me with unfailing support and encouragement throughout my two-and-a-half decades of education, from preschool all the way through graduate school.
Last, and certainly not least, my love and thanks go out to my girlfriend and partner Valerie Cowan for challenging and inspiring me in my research, my personal goals, and everything in between.

This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you all.
