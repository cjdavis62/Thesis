\chapter{CUORE}

CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is located in Gran Sasso, Italy, and utilizes a bolometric method to search for \zeronubb. The experiment will run with 988 crystals of TeO$_2$ held at roughly 10 mK.
The source of \zeronubb~are the $^{130}$Te nuclei inside of the crystals ($34.2\%$ natural abundance \cite{Fehr200483}).
Thus, in this setup, the crystals act as both sources and detectors of \zeronubb. When energy is deposited in the crystals, such as from the electrons emitted during \zeronubb, the temperature of the crystals rises.
The Q-value of the decay of interest, viz. $^{130}\textrm{Te} \rightarrow ^{130}\textrm{Xe} + e + e$, is $2527.518\pm 0.013$ keV \cite{Redshaw:2009cf, Scielzo:2009nh, Rahaman:2011zz}.
This high Q-value is well-separated from other naturally occurring environmental $\gamma$'s except for $^{60}$Co at 2506 keV and $^{208}$Tl at 2615 keV.
However, the resolution of the CUORE crystals is $7.7\pm0.5$ keV, which means that these peaks do not significantly worsen the background in the region of interest at the Q-value.
In addition, this resolution aids in understanding background sources that deposit energy the detector as each \gamma~line can be observed above the Compton background, which aids in identifying particular background sources.

\section{CUORE Detectors}

\subsection{Particle Detection with Bolometers}
\label{ssec:Particle Detectrion with Bolometers}
As noted in \autoref{sec:State of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Experiments}, current experiments in the field of \zeronubb~use a wide array of technologies to identify \zeronubb~events.
However, CUORE utilizes a different method of calorimetry than its counterparts in that it uses a technique known as the bolometric method.
As particles pass through matter, the energy they deposit is eventually carried into the surrounding material as heat.
This method requires a mass that acts as a thermal capacitor, a weak thermal connection to a heat bath, and a thermometer (generally a thermistor) and CUORE's setup is sketched in \autoref{fig:thermal_crystal_cartoon} and a sample pulse is shown in \autoref{fig:Sample_pulse}.
The detectors in CUORE, $\textrm{TeO}_2$~crystals, respond to energy deposition by a temperature rise according to
\begin{equation}
\delta T = \delta E/C(T).
\end{equation}
At low C, $\delta T$ is maximized; therefore, the crystals are operated at low temperatures where C(T) is given by the Debye Model:
\begin{equation}
C(T)\sim (\frac{T}{\Theta_D})^3
\end{equation} 
where $\Theta_D$ is the Debye temperature for \teotwo, $232\pm7~\textrm{K}$ \cite{BolometerCalculations}. This strong temperature dependence on the heat capacity is what drives the need for low temperatures in CUORE, where we have achieved an operational temperature of $\sim10$ mK.
The custom cryostat used to do this is described later on in \autoref{sec:CUORE Cryostat}.
At these temperatures, a 1 MeV energy deposit in a single CUORE crystal would cause the temperature to rise to $\sim 100~\textrm{\mu K}$.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Bolometer Thermometry Instrumentation}
Of course, an integral component to the bolometric method is the choice of thermometer used to detect these changes in temperature.
The choice of thermometer that CUORE uses is a Neutron Transmutation Doped (NTD) germanium thermistor due to its reproducibility and uniformity, which is critically important across CUORE's crystal array. However, a drawback to this is that each NTD thermistor must be individually cut from a block and then mounted onto each bolometer \cite{NTDThermistor}.

Figure from \cite{Alduino:2016vjd}.}
\label{fig:NTD}
\end{figure}

The NTD thermistors are created by irradiating pure Ge with a flux of thermal neutrons, and the NTD sensors used in CUORE were irradiated at the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory.
This flux produces Ga, As, and Se, which dopes the Ge, and the doping stops before the Ge reaches a critical doping threshold such that it still remains a semiconductor.
Above this threshold, the Ge material acts as a metal where resistivity goes to 0 at 0 K, but just below this threshold, the resistivity increases sharply.
This is due to the fact that the doping causes conduction electrons in the material to localize into the doped atoms which are spread out into the germanium.
When conducting at high temperatures, the electrons tunnel to the nearest available unoccupied sites in the material.
At low temperatures, however, such as the $<1~\textrm{K}$ temperatures of the CUORE detectors, the resulting lack of higher-energy phonons prevents the electron from tunneling into the nearest sites, and instead favor sites with similar energies to the electron.
In this regime of ``variable range hopping", the resistance of the NTD goes as
\begin{equation}
    R(T) = R_0 e^{\left(\frac{T_0}{T}\right)^p} 
    \label{eq:NTD_Resistivity}
\end{equation}
as shown by Shklovskii and Efros \cite{NTDResistivity}.
This causes the resistivity to have a strong temperature dependence at cryogenic temperature and allows the NTD thermistor to serve as a highly sensitive thermometer to measure the temperature rise as a voltage, as shown in \autoref{fig:Sample_pulse}.
For the NTDs used on the CUORE-0 detectors, the measured values for $T_0$ and $R_0$ are 3.84 K and 1.13 $\Omega$, respectively, corresponding to a resistance of 0.37 G$\Omega$ at 10 mK \cite{Alduino:2016vjd}.
The NTDs used on the CUORE towers have slightly higher resistances, with an average resistance of 0.6-1.1 G$\Omega$ \cite{Nutini:LoadCurves}.

\label{fig:Sample_pulse}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Silicon Heater}
While the detectors are calibrated through physics events on a $\sim$ monthly basis by the calibration system, discussed more in \autoref{chap:DCS}, additional and continuous stabilization is provided through direct heating of the bolometers through a silicon heater that is also attached onto the bolometer, discussed more in \autoref{ssec:Stabilization}.
These heaters are custom-designed $2.33\times2.40\times0.52~\textrm{mm}^3$ high-purity Si chips, shown in \autoref{fig:Si_heater}.
They were manufactured by Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (IRST, now Fondazione Bruno Kessler) in Trento, Italy.
As current passes through these Si chips with resistance $\approx300~\textrm{k}\Omega$, power is dissipated through ohmic losses in the heaters into the bolometers, which is then measured by the NTDs.
By pulsing these heaters with a known energy, the detector response can then be stabilized at various detector baselines.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{Figures/fig05a.pdf}
    \caption[Photograph of a silicon heater.]
    {Photograph of a silicon heater.
    There are four aluminum pads on the chip, and, depending on the pair of pads connected, the resistance across the heater can be 100, 200, or 300 k$\Omega$.}
    \label{fig:Si_heater}
\end{figure}

There are some particular challenges to the bolometric method, however.
The dependence on the heat capacity of the crystal depends on the exact crystalline structure of the crystal, which requires regular calibrations due to possible minute changes.
In addition, this strong temperature dependence, while useful for identifying signal, needs a well-stabilized detector with few disturbances from non-particle thermal sources and a consistent and well-understood temperature baseline.
Finally, the long time constant of the cooling of the crystal, which is generally a few seconds for a 1 MeV pulse, requires that there be a low rate of events in the crystal.
This requirement of a low rate is generally not an issue for physics datataking, as the background rates are necessarily low due to the sensitivity requirements of a \zeronubb~search, but this limits the time it takes to calibrate the bolometer\footnote{This generally becomes an optimization problem, later discussed in \autoref{chap:DCS}, where the time it takes to calibrate a detector with 100 events can be reduced by reducing the activity of a calibration source.}.


\subsection{CUORE Detector Array}
CUORE uses 988 \teotwo~crystals as bolometers arranged in 19 towers with 13 floors as shown in \autoref{fig:cuore_detector_array} and \autoref{fig:cuore_photograph}.
These crystals are $5\times5\times5~\textrm{cm}^3$ in size and have mass 750 g each, for a total of 742 kg of \teotwo.
The crystals are grown by The Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SICCAS) \cite{Arnaboldi:2010fj} and shipped to Italy by boat, avoiding air travel in order to minimize cosmogenic activation \cite{Barghouty:2010kj}.
Taking advantage of the relatively high natural isotopic abundance of Te, shown in \autoref{fig:q_vs_ia-color}, this comes to a total mass of 206 kg of $^{130}$Te and 189 kg of $^{128}$Te.
Each tower is approximately 80 cm tall, such that in operation, these crystals form the coldest cubic meter in the known universe \cite{Ouellet:2014qua}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Figures/CUORE_detector_array_0.png}
    \caption[A schematic of the CUORE detector array.]
    {A schematic of the CUORE detector array.
    The detectors are held in place by the copper frames and arranged in 19 towers with 13 floors each.
    The position of the detector array relative to the rest of the cryostat can be seen in \autoref{fig:cryostat_cad_cutout}.}
    \label{fig:cuore_detector_array}
\end{figure}

Another benefit to using a bolometric method for particle detection is that it enables a ``source $=$ detector" style experiment such that the \zeronubb~and \twonubb~decays happen directly inside the detectors themselves.
This both reduces the amount of material and associated radioactive backgrounds needed in the experiment and also increases the signal detection efficiency of \zeronubb~and \twonubb-like decays.

In order to arrange these bolometers into these 19 towers, the \teotwo~crystals are held together inside copper frames with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) holders.
These holders are designed such that the crystals are held in place firmly at the low temperatures in CUORE\footnote{Although, one of the benefits of using \teotwo~is that its thermal contraction is similar to that of copper, with values of $\Delta l/l \approx 0.27\%$ and $\Delta l / l \approx 0.33\%$, respectively \cite{ALESSANDRELLO1995363}.}.
A rendering of a CUORE tower is shown in \autoref{fig:tower_rendering}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/fig02.pdf}
    \caption[A rendering of the components of a single CUORE tower (left) and floor (right).]
    {A rendering of the components of a CUORE tower (left) and floor (right).
    The copper frames are shared between floors, and only the PTFE and the gold wiring connecting the silicon heaters and NTD thermistors to the wiring on the frames act as the weak thermal contact to the detectors.
    Figure from \cite{Alduino:2016vjd}.}
    \label{fig:tower_rendering}
\end{figure}
It is important to note that the number and size of each component on the towers is minimized as much as possible, while keeping the structural integrity intact.
Since these components are the nearest to the detectors, keeping their radioactivity to a minimum significantly lowers the background and is discussed more in \autoref{ssec:CUORE-0}.
This was one of the improvements from Cuoricino's towers to CUORE's towers, as the amount of copper used in the frames was able to be reduced by a factor of $\sim2.5$.


\subsection{CUORE Tower Construction and Assembly}

\subsubsection{Crystal Growth}
As mentioned in the preceeding section, the first part of the detector construction and tower assembly occurrs with growth of the Te crystals at SICCAS.
This growth was performed in two phases: crystal growth and crystal polishing.
During each procedure, extreme care was taken to minimize bulk contaminations forming in the first phase and surface contaminations in the second \cite{crystal_growth_methods, crystal_growth_methods_2, Barghouty:2010kj}.
During the first procedure, the crystals are grown twice, where, after the first growth, 1 mm is removed from the ingots and the selected best sections of the first growth are used as high-purity powder for the second.
This two-stage growth process enables crystal purity of 99.999\%, up from the 99.99\% purity of commercially available powder.
This increased purity, along with growing the crystals from powder, strongly reduces bulk contaminations of $^{40}$K, which is a particularly problematic background for \twonubb~measurements, as it decays through beta-decay.

After the crystals are grown, they are then cut into cubes with $5 \pm 0.0050$ cm edges and $0.05$ cm chamfers with an average flatness on each face of $<0.001$ cm.
In addition, the cubic faces are oriented parallel to the planes of the crystalline structure of the \teotwo~within $\pm1^{\circ}$ by means of an X-ray on the crystals after their growth.
The cleaning process then takes two steps: first, by means of chemical etching, and, second, by polishing the crystals.
Each of these processes removes approximately $10^5$ atomic layers from the surface of the crystal, which removes surface impurities that may have adsorbed onto the crystal surface and begun to diffuse into the bulk.
At the end of the polishing step, the completed crystal is then triple-bagged in vacuum and stored in groups of 6 in a polyethylene vacuum box in order to avoid exposure to atmospheric radon.

Once the crystals arrive at LNGS, they are immediately placed in storage underground under a flux of nitrogen.
Despite the short $\sim$1 month that the crystals are aboveground causes the crystals to have cosmogenic activation of $^{110m}$Ag and $^{60}$Co that contribute $<1\%$ of the background at the Q-value of $^{130}$Te \cite{PhysRevC.92.024620, BARGHOUTY201316}.

\subsubsection{Parts Selection and Cleaning}
The copper used to house the detectors in the detector array also undergoes an extensive cleaning process.
The copper selected for this is produced by Arubis\footnote{Originally named Norddeutsche Affinerie.} and is their high-purity Electrolytic Tough Pitch (ETP1) copper alloy, called NOSV\footnote{\RaggedRight\url{http://www.aurubis.com/en/our-business/products/aurubis-shapes/materials/shapes-materials-table}}.
This copper was chosen for CUORE due to its radiopurity and its high residual resistance ratio, certified to be over 400.
However, while the bulk contamination of NOSV copper is low, the surface contaminations of commercially-available NOSV copper due to its handling and machining.
This required the development of a stringent cleaning procedure that involved a sequence of tumbling and chemical etching.
In addition, the larger copper shields facing the detector were wrapped in polyethlyene film while the small copper parts on the towers were also subjected to Magnetron plasma etching, TECM.
This cleaning procedure required the copper to be above ground for a total of 4 months between casting and storage underground.
During this time, the cosmogenic activity for CUORE data-taking is estimated to be a negligible value of <50 $\mu$Bq$/$kg.
These procedures were validated during the Three Towers Test  and the surface contamination of the cleaned NOSV copper was measured to be 3.8 nBq/cm$^2$ and 2.0 nBq/cm$^2$ for $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th, respectively \cite{ALESSANDRIA201313}.
The other components on the CUORE towers, viz. the NTDs, the silicon heaters, PTFE holders, etc., are also subjected to a cleaning process and are stored under a nitrogen flux before assembly.
The final bulk contaminations of the components of the CUORE tower are shown in \autoref{tab:NearDetectorSources_Bulk}.

\section{Predecessor Experiments}
\label{sec:Predecessor Experiments}
The CUORE experiment benefits from the experience gained through multiple previous incarnations of this bolometric technique in \teotwo.
Starting with the smallest proof-of-concept detectors, successive generations of this technology have increased in total detector mass and decreased in background in order to increase sensitivity and further probe \zeronubb~decay.
This almost-exponential growth in mass in the different generations of CUORE-like experiments from 73~g to 742~kg is shown in \autoref{fig:bolometer_mass_over_time}.
Of course, as shown in \autoref{eq:sensitivity_short}, the detector mass is only one part of the sensitivity equation, but successive experiments have also significantly reduced backgrounds and other improvements to increase sensitivity beyond merely the increase from increased mass.

\subsection{Cuoricino}

\subsection{CUORE-0}
\label{ssec:CUORE-0}
After the completion of the Cuoricino experiment, an intermediate experiment was planned while working on completing the CUORE cryostat.
This experiment, CUORE-0, was meant to bridge the gap between the two experiments with a single CUORE-like tower placed in the Cuoricino cryostat.
A schematic of the experimental apparatus can be seen in \autoref{fig:CUORE-0_cryostat_schematic}.

\begin{figure} [htbp]

    The CUORE-0 tower is in the center of the cryostat, and the calibration sources are deployed between the OVC and the external lead shield.}
    \label{fig:CUORE-0_cryostat_schematic}
\end{figure}

The purpose of this experiment, besides  making a measurement of \zeronubb, was to validate the improved materials selection and cleaning of the CUORE crystals.
This improvement is quantified in \autoref{fig:cuore-0_vs_cuoricino} where a signficant decease is observed in the \alpha~backgrounds which are due to components nearest to the crystals.
The \gamma~backgrounds are not reduced as significantly as the cryostat is the same between the CUORE and Cuoricino experiments.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/CUORE-0_vs_Cuoricino.pdf}

    There is also some improvement on the level of \gamma~ backgrounds, but as the cryostat is the same, those contaminations remain.
    However, one peak in the $\alpha$ region from $^{210}$Po does not decrease, and may be particular to this single tower.}
    \label{fig:cuore-0_vs_cuoricino}
\end{figure}

CUORE-0 collected data between 2013 and 2015, and during this time, many analysis and data-collection techniques were refined and improved for use in CUORE.
In particular, from the data collected, CUORE-0 was able to make the most precise measurement of \twonubb~decay in $^{130}$Te at the time, listed in \autoref{tab:2nuHalfLife} \cite{Alduino:2016vtd}.
In addition, CUORE-0 also performed a search for \zeronubb~and, in a combined analysis with the Cuoricino experiment, formed the most stringent limit at the time for \zeronubb~decay in $^{130}$Te with a limit of $T^{0ν}_{1/2}>4.0\times10^{24}$ yr \cite{Alfonso:2015wka}.

\section{CUORE Cryostat}
\label{sec:CUORE Cryostat}

Since the heat capacity of the CUORE crystals is so strongly dependent on temperature, it is important to have a system that can cool down the crystals to low temperatures and keep them running in stable conditions over long periods.
To this end, we constructed a cryogen-free custom cryostat to house the crystals.
The cooling components of the cryostat are pulse tubes that cools the cryostat stages at 40 K and 4 K and a dilution refrigerator that is responsible for maintaining the coldest regions of the cryostat, including the crystals at 10 mK.
In addition to cooling the crystals, the cryostat also houses the shielding for the crystals and, since this is a low-background experiment, needs to be made of radiopure materials, especially near the detectors themselves.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/cryostat_Adjusted.png}

\label{fig:cryostat_cad_cutout}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Cooling Systems}
\label{sssec:Cooling Systems}
One of the main cryostat changes between the previous experiments of CUORE-0 and CUORE was the change to a cryogen-free cryostat that uses pulse tubes instead of an external supply of liquid nitrogen, helium, and a 1~K bath.
This change allows for increased live-time of the experiment as data-taking does not need to be interrupted by the need to refill the bath.
However, this does come at a cost of increased mechanical noise as the 5 pulse tubes in CUORE input mechanical vibrations onto the cryostat.
In addition, since the 5 pulse tubes on CUORE are not symmetrically aligned due to space constraints, it is nontrivial to find a phase configuration that minimizes the noise, requiring an in-depth scan of varying pulse tube phases to find when the mechanical noise induced by the pulse tubes is minimized over the detectors.
Since the cyrostat needs to reach temperatures of 10 mK, a dilution refrigerator is used as the main cooling mechanism in the coldest stages of the cryostat.
A dilution refrigerator works by taking advantage of the phase boundary between dilute and concentrated phases of a $^3$He and $^4$He mixture, shown in \autoref{fig:He_phase_diagram}.
In the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator on the 100~mK stage of the CUORE cryostat, $^3$He flows from the concentrated phase to the dilute phase.
This process extracts energy from the environment of the mixing chamber, and, by extension, the coldest stages of the cryostat, as energy is required to move the $^3$He across the phase boundary\footnote{Of course, the Universe's entropy is not reduced by this exchange and additional energy is used to induce this endothermic cooling.}.

{CUORE background budget.
The CUORE goal is 0.01 counts/keV/kg/y with most of the background due to the surfaces of cryostat elements nearest to the crystal and the bulk of the Roman lead.}

The background goal of CUORE is to have no greater than 0.01 counts/keV/kg/yr in the region of interest, defined to be a 100 keV interval from 2470 keV to 2570 keV.
In order to achieve this low background, the parts nearest to the detectors undergo intensive cleaning.
The contamination of these surfaces is given in \color{red} label \color{black}.
