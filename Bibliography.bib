  abstract={Recent solar and reactor neutrino data have convincingly established that electron neutrinos and antineutrinos are subject to flavour transitions driven by neutrino masses and mixing. In addition, such data can be used to prove that the interaction of neutrinos in matter modifies the flavour transition pattern with respect to the case of propagation in vacuum, as predicted long ago by Mikheyev, Smirnov and Wolfenstein (MSW). We present a brief review of how the current evidence for MSW solar neutrino transitions has developed in recent years, and how it has been strengthened by the latest reactor neutrino data presented at the Neutrino 2004 Conference.}

  abstract={Neutrinoless double-beta (0 νββ ) decay is a hypothesized process where in some even-even nuclei it might be possible for two neutrons to simultaneously decay into two protons and two electrons without emitting neutrinos. This is possible only if neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e. fermions that are their own antiparticles. Neutrinos being Majorana particles would explicitly violate lepton number conservation, and might play a role in the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would also provide complementary information related to neutrino masses. The Majorana Collaboration is constructing the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, with a total of 40-kg Germanium detectors, to search for the 0 νββ decay of 76 Ge and to demonstrate a background rate at or below 3 counts/(ROI·t·y) in the 4 keV region of interest (ROI) around the 2039 keV Q-value for 76 Ge 0 νββ decay. In this paper, we discuss the physics of neutrinoless double beta decay and then focus on the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, including its design and approach to achieve ultra-low backgrounds and the status of the experiment.}

  abstract={The nuclear matrix elements that govern the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay must be accurately calculated if experiments are to reach their full potential. Theorists have been working on the problem for a long time but have recently stepped up their efforts as ton-scale experiments have begun to look feasible. Here we review past and recent work on the matrix elements in a wide variety of nuclear models and discuss work that will be done in the near future. Ab initio nuclear-structure theory, which is developing rapidly, holds out hope of more accurate matrix elements with quantifiable error bars.}

Since the CUORE detecting elements will consist of TeO2 crystals, we have measured the specific heat of this material down to 60 mK with the thermal relaxation method. Previous available data were taken at temperatures higher than 0.6 K. Our results are clearly consistent with a lattice dominated specific heat. The Debye temperature, evaluated to be (232{\textpm}7) K, is in excellent agreement with the elastic constant values measured by other authors. The knowledge of the Debye temperature allows a simple prediction of the pulse amplitude of presently working bolometers.",

After thermal annealing at 400{\textdegree}C for six hours in a pure argon atmosphere, the samples were characterized with Hall effect and resistivity measurements between 300 and 0.3 K. The results show that the resistivity in the low temperature, hopping conduction regime can be approximated by $\rho$ = $\rho$oexp($\Delta$/T). The three more heavily-doped samples show values for $\rho$o and $\Delta$ ranging from 430 to 3.3 $\Omega$ cm and from 4.9 to 2.8 K respectively. The excellent reproducibility of neutron transmutation doping and the values of $\rho$o and $\Delta$ make NTD germanium a prime candidate for the fabrication of low-temperature, low-noise bolometers. The large variation in the tabulated values of the termal neutron cross sections for the different germanium isotopes makes it clear that accurate measurements of these cross sections for well defined neutron energy spectra would be highly desirable.",

abstract = "Massive bolometric detectors operated at very low temperatures (≃10mK) can be used to search for rare events, such as Double Beta Decay and interactions of Dark Matter candidates. In experiments of this type it is important to keep the detector response steady within 0.1% level over periods of the order of one year or more, often in conflict with the intrinsic instabilities of the cryogenic setups. Here, a powerful method to stabilize detector response is described: using calibrated amounts of energy, injected by means of alpha particles or resistive heaters, a correlation between pulse amplitude and detector bias can be established. This correlation can be used to correct off-line the amplitudes of every pulse. The satisfactory results achieved with this technique are reported and discussed. For this purpose heavily doped Si heaters with steady resistances at cryogenic temperatures were designed and succesfully tested."

abstract = "Improved results of a series of measurements carried out on two different types of Roman lead to be used in shields for experiments on rare events are reported. The chemical impurities in both samples have been determined by neutron activation. Underground measurements based on γ-spectroscopy on large masses of the two types of lead, show the absence in both samples of radioactive contamination from 214Bi and 232Th, in secular equilibrium, with upper limits of a few tenths of a mBq kg−1. The contamination from 40K is less than a few mBq kg−1. Much care has been addressed to the contamination due to 210Pb which breaks secular equilibrium and which contributes to most of the background in experiments searching low energy events like direct interactions of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS). We have applied to this problem the technique of cryogenic detection and found for the two samples upper limits for contamination of 210Pb of 4 and 7 mBq kg−1, the lowest ever determined for any type of lead."

Each channel is an active six-pole Bessel–Thomson low-pass filter (LPF) with a roll-off of 120dB/decade. In order to adapt the bandwidth to every detector, the filtering frequency can be selected independently for every channel by a remote control between four possible values (8, 12, 16 or 20Hz). The board is equipped with an ARM microcontroller which communicates with the on-board peripherals via I2C synchronous serial bus and with the remote control via CAN-bus. Important features are the low-cost, the compact realization and the capability to perform diagnostic routine remotely."
